I'm finally getting around to building a website that closely resembles an internet presence for Drop-D Designs.

The idea is to start with a lean and mean website, adding flourishes on top as I go. This follows my mantra for web development using progressive enhancement.

That is, starting with a baseline that everyone can use and progressively enhancing with features for modern browsers and more capable devices.

The platform to build the site is [Jekyll][jekyll] and I'm still loving coding with [Sublime Text][sublime].
